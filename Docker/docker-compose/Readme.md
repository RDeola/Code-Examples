# Docker Compose

Is a file to compose the creation of docker containers

In the file [node_mysql.yml](https://github.com/RDeola/Code-Examples/blob/main/Docker/docker-compose/node_mysql.yml) you will find an example with two containers integrated.
The first one, a node(version 16.14, not a especific choice. Just an example) image, working integrated with a mySql image.
The file is commented, but, for now, only in pt-br. I will put another one with english comments in the future.
